This `data` folder contains the data to produce the results and visualisations for the manuscript in preparation:  
#### Assessing the Calibration in Toxicological in Vitro Models with Conformal Prediction
Morger A., Svensson F., Arvidsson McShane S., Gauraha N., Norinder U., Spjuth O., Volkamer A.

### data_signatures
This folder contains the signatures generated for the Tox21 datasets (i.e. Tox21Train, Tox21Test, Tox21Score), 
which are the input data for the computational experiments presented in the manuscript.

### data_statistics
This folder contains the results obtained from the computational experiments presented in the manuscript. 
From the statistics data, the visualisations (i.e. calibration and efficiency plots, boxplots) can be reproduced.
